# Animalia
Animalia is a android application we developed as a part of the course User Interfaces.
It provides a fun learning experience for kids, intended to teach them about different  animal species through its playful interface

It is based on a [RESTful API](https://github.com/bevkoski/animalia-api) built using Ruby, Heroku, Sinatra, PostgreSQL by [bevkoski](https://github.com/bevkoski/).
