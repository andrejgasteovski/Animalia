# Animalia
Animalia is an android application we developed as a part of the course User Interfaces.
It provides a fun learning experience for kids, while intending to teach them about different animal species through its playful interface.

It is based on a [RESTful API](https://github.com/bevkoski/animalia-api) built using Ruby, Heroku, Sinatra and PostgreSQL by [bevkoski](https://github.com/bevkoski/).
